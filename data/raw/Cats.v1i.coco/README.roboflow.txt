The dataset includes 17000 images.
Jets are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.2 percent of pixels
